![Splatapult Build](https://github.com/hyperlogic/splatapult/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

A program to display 3d gaussian splats files

splatapult [OPTIONS] ply_filename

Options
-------------
-v, --openxr
    launch app in vr mode, using openxr runtime

-f, --fullscreen
    launch window in fullscreen

-d, --debug
    enable debug logging

--fp16
    Use 16-bit half-precision floating frame buffer, to reduce color banding artifacts

--fp32
    Use 32-bit floating point frame buffer, to reduce color banding even more

--nosh
    Don't load/render full sh, this will reduce memory usage and higher performance

-h, --help
    show help

Desktop Controls
--------------------
* wasd - move
* q, e - roll
* t, g - up, down
* arrow keys - look
* right mouse button - hold down for mouse look.
* gamepad - if present, right stick to rotate, left stick to move, bumpers to roll
* c - toggle between initial SfM point cloud (if present) and gaussian splats.
* n - jump to next camera
* p - jump to previous camera
* y - toggle rendering of camera frustums
* h - toggle rendering of camera path
* return - save the current position and orientation of the world into a vr.json file.

VR Controls
---------------
* left stick - move
* right stick - snap turn
* f - show hide floor carpet.
* single grab - translate the world.
* double grab - rotate and translate the world.
* triple grab - (double grab while trigger is depressed) scale, rotate and translate the world.
* c - toggle between initial SfM point cloud (if present) and gaussian splats.
* y - toggle rendering of camera frustums
* h - toggle rendering of camera path
* return - save the current position and orientation/scale of the world into a vr.json file.

Config Files
----------------------
If a "_vr.json" file is found, it will be used to determine the proper starting position, scale and orienation for vr mode.
You can create your own _vr.json file by manipulating the scene via grab in vr mode, then press return to save.

Splatapult supports the same dir structure that [Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) code will output.
Which is as follows:

```
dir/
    point_cloud/
        iteration_30000/
            point_cloud.ply
            point_cloud_vr.json
    input.ply
    cameras.json
```

input.ply contains the point cloud and cameras.json will contain the camera orientations from the SfM stage.

If the "cameras.json" file is found in the same dir as the ply_filename or it's parent dirs, it will be loaded.
The 'n' and 'p' keys can then be used to cycle thru the camera viewpoints.

It will also support files downloaded from lumalabs.ai, but in this case there will be no point clouds or cameras.

```
dir/
    mycapture.ply
    mycapture_vr.json
```
